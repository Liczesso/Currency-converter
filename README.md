# Welcome to my page!  
This is a second project I am using to learn programming. It is based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with elements named according to the BEM convention. This project focuses on learning how to make forms, using an online currency exchange office as an example. After entering the amount to be exchanged and selecting the target currency, the application will calculate its equivalent in the new currency. The default rates are accurate as of 26.08.2024. To increase accuracy, it is also possible to manually enter the current rate. Another new feature in this project is the addition of a centered background photo. Check out my project:
