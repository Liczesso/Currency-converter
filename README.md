Welcome to my page! This is the project I use to learn programming. It's based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript and its elements are named according to the BEM convention. It contains basic, frequently used elements of websites (e.g. sections, header, navigation, image, table, button) and their formatting (e.g. background color, text color, bold, italic, border). I invite you to check out my project:
